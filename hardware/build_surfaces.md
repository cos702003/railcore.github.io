title: Build Surfaces
---  

There is plenty of good information out there on bed surfaces and their adhesion. This is just a summary of any surfaces when used with the Railcore.

**Lokbuild** is the build surface on the BOM. Compatible with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor and BLtouch.

**PrintBite+** - printed parts “self release” as the heat bed cools down with this surface. However be aware that it seems that it may be translucent to IR and so not a good surface when combined with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor (which is the standard on the BOM)

**BuildTak** Works well with BLTouch, folks report erratic results with IR. Stuff sometimes ticks too well when used on a fixed bed; is best suited for a removable flex bed like the magnetic bed.  

**PEX** Transparent surface so will not work with an IR sensor. Works well with BLTouch. Tends to require hotter bed temps over 70C for PLA adhesion. 

**Garolite** is mainly used for printing Nylons, such as NylonX from Matterhackers. Provides excellent adhesion for Nylons. It is recommended to start with a higher Z offset (away from the bed) and work down to a suitable Z-Offset. Otherwise parts may not come off the surface without damage to both. Bed temps of 70C recommended. Works well with BLTouch, other probes untested, but should work ok as it is a solid opaque surface.
